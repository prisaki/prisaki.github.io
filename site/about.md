# About Page

This site was created on Jekyll[Jekyll][1] and the source code for this site can be found [here][2].

I chose Jekyll since I wanted to explore making a static site and it makes implementing it fairly simple. It's main focus is to create a website for hosting a blog, which was an important when I began working on the site. Currently that will take a backseat as there was a side project that caught my attention, which will hopefully be posted on this site in the near future.

# Making a Portfolio

This site is entirely done with CSS and HTML with Jekyll adding backend operations to build a blog. I previously studied Java and C in undergraduate however never got to investigate with building visuals.

# Portfolio Design

One of my weaknesses is visual design. For the portfolio I wanted to experiment with more spartan writing, using visuals to demonstrate the high levels of the project to allow readers to glance through the case studies quicker.

The focus on sparse, concise content was to help hiring personal. On average 30 seconds is spent per each portfolio, obviously not much reading is done. In those 30 seconds the reader must be visually engaged. Making the stages of the project understood visually allows me to convey my work faster. If interest is established they may read through the site to make final judgements.

This restaurant is run phenomenally, with great food at a deserving price. Unlike it’s competitors, the food may be one of the least interesting things about it.

Enhancing websites and applications gets a primary focus in talk about UX but it doesn’t have to be. Plenty of physical places have poor and awkward designs. 

Houston’s doesn’t. It does it’s best to deceive you that it’s a chain and it removes much of the effort we place as customers. There is no loud background music deafening conversations, intimate lighting where you can’t read a menu, even the awkward fumbling of closing a tab at the bar when a table opens up… It gives a place to eat and enjoy it.

I have an odd fascination with fonts but more-so with how it affects readers. In creating a style aesthetics are the primary focus to create an emotion to demonstrate a brand in many cases.

But fonts have real, impactful, affects on the reader, even affecting reading speed and comprehension.

It’s exciting to see Hanzi get more attention in this regard. Particularly on some Windows computers I find reading them difficult since they sometimes get pixelated.
