    <h1 class="post-title">About Me</h1>
            
    <p>This site was created on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" style="color:#0000FF" class="link">Jekyll</a> and the source code for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/prisaki/prisaki.github.io" style="color:#0000FF" class="link">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I chose Jekyll because I wanted experience in creating a static website that had blog functionality. I am currently working on a new project exploring video and design.</p>
            
    <h2 class="post-content">Making a Portfolio</h2>
            
    <p>This site is primarily CSS and HTML. I studied Java and C in undergraduate, although I never had an project to test front-end code. My background has a stronger focus in research so I am still playing catch up with my visual design skills.</p>

       <h2 class="post-content" style="padding-top:15px; top-border:1px solid #e8e8e8>Portfolio Design</h2>
            
    <p>One of my weaknesses as a designer is that I lack experience tying written content with visuals, partly due to coursework requirements. My main focus in creating the case studies was to have a concise idea of the problem and its constraints, with visuals to engage the reader and reduce the text associated with it.</p>
            
    <p>The focus on sparse, concise content was to help hiring personal. On average 30 seconds is spent per each portfolio. In that time the reader must be visually engaged. Making the stages of the project understood visually allows me to convey my work quickly. People can then review the specific content if they want more details.</p>

         <li><h3 class="post-content">Welcome to Hillstone, America's Favorite Restaurant</h3></li>
       </ul>
         
    <p>This restaurant is run phenomenally well, with great food at a deserving price. Unlike their competitors, its food may be one of the least interesting things about it.</p>
            
    <p>Similar to Hillstone's analogy, websites and tech applications get a primary focus when talking about UX, which doesn't need to be the case. Hillstone’s does it’s best to deceive you that it’s a chain and it removes some effort we place as customers. There is no loud background music deafening conversations, no intimate lighting creating unreadable menus, or even the awkward fumbling of closing a tab at the bar when a table opens up… It gives us a place to eat and lets customers enjoy it.</p>

    <li><h3 class="post-content">The Long, Incredibly Tortuous, and Fascinating Process of Creating A Chinese Font</h3></li>
        </ul>
                
    <p>I have an odd fascination with fonts but more-so with how it affects readers. Often, aesthetics are the primary focus to create an emotion to demonstrate a brand.</p>
            
    <p>But fonts have real impacts on the reader, even affecting reading speed and comprehension.</p>
            
    <p>It’s exciting to see Hanzi get more attention in this regard. Particularly on some Windows computers they can be difficult to read since they sometimes get pixelated, obscuring the character's stroke order.</p>
