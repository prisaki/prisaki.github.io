    <h1 class="post-title">About Me</h1>
            
    <p>This site was created on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" style="text:#OOOOEE" class="link">Jekyll</a> and the source code for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/prisaki/prisaki.github.io" style="text:#OOOOEE" class="link">Here</a>.</p>

    <p>I chose Jekyll since I wanted to explore making a static site and it makes implementing it fairly simple. It ties together well with showing previous writing which was an important when I began working on the site. Currently that will take a backseat as there was another side project that caught my attention, which will hopefully be posted on this site in the near future.</p>
            
    <h2 class="post-content">Making a Portfolio</h2>
            
    <p>This site is primarily CSS and JS with Jekyll adding backend operations to build a blog. I previously studied Java and C in undergraduate. My background has a stronger focus in research and I am still playing catch up with my visual design skills. That said, I go back and forth on preferring styled components or design tools like Sketch and Photoshop (of the two I prefer Sketch). The ability to scale on web I find fantastic, constantly shifting objects in an illustrator is incredibly tedious and is personally a huge distraction.</p>

    <h2 class="post-content">Portfolio Design</h2>
            
    <p>One of my weaknesses as a designer is that I lack experience tying written content with visuals, partly due to coursework requirements. My main focus in creating the case studies was to have a concise idea of the problem and its constraints, with visuals to engage the reader and reduce the text associated with it.</p>
            
    <p>The focus on sparse, concise content was to help hiring personal. On average 30 seconds is spent per each portfolio, obviously not much reading is done. In those 30 seconds the reader must be visually engaged. Making the stages of the project understood visually allows to convey my work. People can then review and read the specific content to make any final judgements.</p>

    <h2 class="post-content">Interesting Design Articles</h2>

    <h3 class="post-title-alt">Welcome to Hillstone, America's Favorite Restaurant</h3>
            
    <p>This restaurant is run phenomenally, with great food at a deserving price. Unlike it’s competitors, the food may be one of the least interesting things about it.</p>
            
    <p>Enhancing websites and applications gets a primary focus in talk about UX but it doesn’t have to be. Plenty of physical places have poor and awkward designs</p>
            
    <p>Houston’s doesn’t. It does it’s best to deceive you that it’s a chain and it removes much of the effort we place as customers. There is no loud background music deafening conversations, intimate lighting where you can’t read a menu, even the awkward fumbling of closing a tab at the bar when a table opens up… It gives a place to eat and enjoy it.</p>

    <h3 class="post-title-alt">The long, incredibly tortuous, and fascinating process of creating a Chinese font</h3>
                
    <p>I have an odd fascination with fonts but more-so with how it affects readers. In creating a style aesthetics are the primary focus to create an emotion to demonstrate a brand in many cases.</p>
            
    <p>But fonts have real, impactful, affects on the reader, even affecting reading speed and comprehension.</p>
            
    <p>It’s exciting to see Hanzi get more attention in this regard. Particularly on some Windows computers I find reading them difficult since they sometimes get pixelated.</p>
